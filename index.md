Welcome to my personal website!

I am a Software Engineer with 6+ years of experience in the industry. Technology and innovation are the things I am the most passionate about. In my spare time I also enjoy travelling.

Here you may find the information about my [professional experience](/cv/). You may also check out some of my [hobby projects](/hobby-projects/).
